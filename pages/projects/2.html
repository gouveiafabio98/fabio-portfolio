        <p>Crimes Exemplares (Exemplary Crimes) is a literary work, composed of small texts, that report various crimes,
            in the most varied forms and situa-tions. Mostly surreal in nature, these criminal acts have impulses of
            extreme violence, without an
            ethical or moral nature, and, with its sort of comic speech, it enhances the absurd. Although it is
            impossible to calculate its veracity, these short stories challenge the reader to ask what is the limit of
            mental sanity and what can trigger
            the unreasonability of this type of acts.</p>
        <p>In both the objects developed, these contrasting dualities were explored: the sobriety and the madness, the
            animal and the innocent, the veracity and the unbelief, supported by elements that create a connection to
            the years of the crimes. </p>
