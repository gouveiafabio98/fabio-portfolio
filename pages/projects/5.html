        <p>This is an academic project within ‘Project 1 - Web Identity ’ unit at the University of Coimbra, where we
            had to create a visual identity of the event ‘Ciclo de Conversas - Design e Multimédia‘ that takes place in
            Coimbra, Portugal every year.</p>
        <p>Our identity has been chosen to represent the event in 2020. We created a square divided in two, which forms
            the two C‘s in the initials of the event (CCDM), to match the square we created a modular typography and we
            wrote the remaining letters of the initials with this.</p>
        <p>Our logo adapts to all formats like posters, computers, phones, banners, etc., and with this potencial we
            could wrote all the information needed inside of it.</p>
