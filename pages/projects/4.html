        <p>Academic project This is an academic project within 'Multimedia programming' curricular unit in University of
            Coimbra, where we had to create a music visualizer with manipulation of images, video, particle system and
            irregular forms.</p>
        <p>Functionalities In this music visualizer, you can add your own music and listen to it in three different
            reproducers. Each one as their own functionalities who react to the song, the first one use the album cover
            of the music creating an effect of an old TV, the second one is a moon who shoot stars around and the last
            one a DJ table.</p>
